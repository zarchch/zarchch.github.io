Artist Search Pro is an application focused on retrieving artists from the Artsy platform. <!--excerpt--> Artist Search Pro currently offers two types of applications: Web and Android. The frontend of the web application is built with Angular and Bootstrap. The Android application is developed using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Retrofit, and Coil. The backend for both applications is implemented with MongoDB and Express.js. Both can be deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
