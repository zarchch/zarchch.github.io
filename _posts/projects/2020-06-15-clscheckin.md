**ClsCheckIn** is an Android application used for checking attendance in a class.<!--excerpt--> The whole application is divided into two parts. One is provided for students. The other one is provided for teachers. For students, they can use it to upload and update their personal information. For teachers, besides uploading and updating their personal information, they can upload and update attendance sheets and obtain the information about class attendance immediately by uploading a picture. If you want to run the android application properly, you should use [ClsCheckIn](https://github.com/ZZwarn1998/ClsCheckIn/tree/master/ClsCheckIn), [ClsCheckIn_py](https://github.com/ZZwarn1998/ClsCheckIn/tree/master/ClsCheckIn_py) and [ClsCheckIn_server]([./ClsCheckIn_server](https://github.com/ZZwarn1998/ClsCheckIn/tree/master/ClsCheckIn_server)) simultaneously.For more information, please visit [the repository](https://github.com/ZZwarn1998/ClsCheckIn).
